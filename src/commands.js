Hope you're having a great day, and get ready to prove yourself in these mystery filled series of challenges!\nThe format for this CTF is a little odd, due to everyone's different timezones and busy schedules, we've opted to instead make this a more csual and solo experience, where each player is free to start and progress through the challenges as they'd like, this also gives us the opportunity to release challenges periodically whenever enough time is available to work on them, we hope you'll enjoy your time with this mini project!\n\nPlease do try to be respectful throughtout the event and stick to the guidelines outlined below!\n")

Etti was known to stay in her room most of the time, rarely going out. Though when a friend of her's went to visit her room's door was unlocked, and her room was empty, and there's been no sign of her since.\n Her phone is off, and there's no recent activity on her social media. Friends and professors describe her as a quiet, focused student with no history of trouble.\n Your first step is to investigate her dorm room and belongings. As of now, this appears to be a routine missing personâ€™s case, but be thoroughâ€”details can easily be overlooked.\n Good luck, Detective.")
